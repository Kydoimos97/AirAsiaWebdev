Not everything works like I want to yet but that is for assignment 3.
The core pages are all there and fully functional.

To create the database run the SQL files.
After that the database tables can be reset from the admin page which can be accessed when logged in as the admin user.

There are two default users with [username - password]
1. admin - admin
2. msis@utah.edu - root

Passwords are stored in hashes, so they can't simply be read or updated directly in the database.
